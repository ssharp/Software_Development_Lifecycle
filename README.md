# Software_Development_Lifecycle
This repository is for projects and work done in the SNHU class CS-250: Software Development Lifecycle. The projects were completed over multiple sprints in which I took on multiple roles such as Scrum Master, Product Owner, Tester, and Developer to learn and implement an Agile methodology to project management. By taking on these various roles I was able to critically evaluate code and functionality for improvements to enhance UX and UI. I did this by learning to quickly adapt and change my approaches as required in order to provide the most project value. The work included in this portfolio should reflect my growing knowledge in multiple languages, IDEs, and contexts, and increased confidence in my abilities to provide functional products and improvements.
